# Advent of Code (dlang)

These are solutions to Advent of Code year 2020 ( adventofcode.com/2020 ), in
Dlang. I make no promises about making it very far.

I've been doing a lot of C++ and have been learning Zig recently, but as far as
D goes I have not used it in a long time. So for me this is the perfect usecase
for D (scripting related)

It's less focus on code clarity, cleanliness, performance, etc and more on
just being able to finish as many puzzles as I can this month.

to compile this, do `dmd dayX/ans0.d`
to run it as a script, do `./dayX/ans0.d` if `rdmd` is installed on your
machine.
